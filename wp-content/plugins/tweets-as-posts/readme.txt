Tweets As Posts imports all tweets tagged with specified hashtags from twitter accounts into WordPress as posts.

== Description ==

Tweets As Posts (TAP) for WordPress is a plugin that allows you to import tweets from twitter into WordPress as posts by simply stating twitter names and hashtags in the confirguration.

Unlimited number of Twitter accounts can be used making both personal and company websites easy to update from multiple twitter accounts.

A custom list of hashtags allows control over which tweets are imported. (Future versions will offer even more options for control)

The imported tweets are added to WordPress as posts, into a category specified in the settings confirguration, and displayed on the front-end with Search Engine Friendly URLs.

The import update runs once an hour automatically or can be forced to run from the settings page of the plugin e.g. if you require an important tweet to appear on the site immediately.
